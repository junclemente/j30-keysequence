# Project: Key Sequence Detection

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

#### Project takeaways
* `window.addEventListener('keyup', {e})` - Used to track any keyboard presses. The * `e.key` event is used to add the keypress to the array. There are also the `keypress` and `keydown` events. 
* `array.prototype.slice()` - Used to manage the length of the array by using the length of the secretCode and counting backwards from the end of the array. 
* [cornify.com](http://cornify.com) - Fun little javascript add-on that randomly adds rainbows and unicorns to the page when called.
